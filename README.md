# MNIST_CNN
This repository consists of the CNN implementation using tensorflow in the MNIST dataset that </br>
consists of the handwritten digits images over 60000 .</br>
CNN is one of the best practice for image classification but i have also evaluated the same dataset </br>
using ANN(Artificial neural networks or Deep neural networks ) that is to get through the structure of ANN model but </br> is not recommended.
